# scRNA-Seq-normalization-

The purpose of this repository is to compare different normalization methods for scRNA-Seq data. In my Master Thesis I proposed a new  method of normalization based on the Pareto distribution. This method normalizes the data matrix with the alpha parameter of the Pareto distribution fitted on every sample.
